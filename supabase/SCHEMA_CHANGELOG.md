# Schema changelog

## 2026-03-22 – `create_game` RPC 404 on client

**Symptom:** `POST .../rest/v1/rpc/create_game` returns **404 Not Found**.

**Cause:** The DB is missing the latest `create_game` (app sends `p_description`, `p_requirements`, etc.) and/or **no `GRANT EXECUTE`** for `anon` / `authenticated`.

**Fix (Supabase → SQL Editor, in order):**

1. Run **`migrations/20260321000000_games_requirements.sql`** (defines `create_game` + `get_games_nearby` with `requirements`).
2. Run **`migrations/20260322000000_create_game_grants.sql`** (grants + `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema'`).

Verify:

```sql
select pg_get_function_identity_arguments(oid)
from pg_proc
where proname = 'create_game' and pronamespace = 'public'::regnamespace;
```

You should see the nine-argument signature ending in `jsonb`.

## 2025-03-25 – Host deletes own game

**File:** `migrations/20250325000000_games_host_delete_rls.sql`  
**Run after:** `games` + RLS enabled.

| Change | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Policy `Hosts can delete own games`** | `DELETE` on `public.games` where `auth.uid() = created_by`; cascades remove participants, messages, `game_results` |

Client: `deleteHostedGame(gameId)` in `src/lib/api.ts`; map popup **Delete game** (host only).

## 2025-03-24 – Leave game (delete own `game_participants` row)

**File:** `migrations/20250324000000_game_participants_delete_rls.sql`  
**Run after:** `game_participants` exists.

| Change | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Policy `Users can delete own participation`** | `DELETE` where `auth.uid() = user_id` so **Unjoin** persists; without it, RLS blocks all deletes and the UI can look “stuck joined” after refresh |

## 2025-03-23 – Profile text search (`search_profiles`)

**File:** `migrations/20250323000000_search_profiles_trgm.sql`

### What was added

| Change | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **`pg_trgm`** | Trigram similarity for bounded name/handle matching |
| **`profiles.display_name_search`** | Generated stored column: `lower(trim(display_name))` |
| **`profiles.handle_search`** | Generated stored column from `athlete_profile->>'handle'` (no `@`) |
| **GIN (trgm) indexes** | Fast `%` / `LIKE` style lookups on those columns |
| **`search_profiles(q, p_lat, p_lng, radius_km, limit_n, p_exclude)`** | Public-safe people search; optional geo filter via `profile_locations` |

Run after `profiles.athlete_profile` exists. Then **`NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';`** if PostgREST does not see the new function immediately.

## 2025-03-22 – Storage `avatars` bucket + RLS

**File:** `migrations/20250322000000_storage_avatars_bucket.sql`

### What was added

| Change | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **storage.buckets `avatars`** | Public bucket for 2D avatars, story media, post/reel uploads (if missing) |
| **Policies on `storage.objects`** | `SELECT` public read; `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` for `authenticated` users only under `{uid}/…`, `stories/{uid}/…`, or `feed/posts|reels/{uid}/…` |

Without this, the client often gets **HTTP 400** on `POST /storage/v1/object/avatars/...` (no bucket or RLS blocking insert). See `MIGRATION_ORDER.md` step 10.

## 2025-03-20 – Athlete profile JSON on `profiles`

**File:** `migrations/20250320000000_athlete_profile_jsonb.sql`  
**Run after:** `profiles` exists (from base `schema.sql` or equivalent).

### What was added

| Change | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| **profiles.athlete_profile** | `jsonb` default `'{}'` — sport card, metrics, highlights, etc.; validated in the app |
| **`NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema'`** | End of migration file — refreshes PostgREST so PATCH/SELECT see the column without waiting |

Until this runs, the REST API returns **400** if the client selects or patches `athlete_profile`. If the column already exists but PATCH still fails, run `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';` once in the SQL Editor. Then clear browser key `fun_profiles_athlete_column` (or `clearAthleteProfileColumnCache()`). See `MIGRATION_ORDER.md`.

## 2025-03-15 – Gamification, 3D avatars, notifications

**File:** `migrations/20250315000000_gamification_avatars_notifications.sql`  
**Run after:** `schema.sql`

### What was added

| Change | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| **profiles.avatar_id** | Ready Player Me (or other) 3D avatar ID for map markers; frontend uses `https://models.readyplayer.me/{avatar_id}.glb?quality=medium` |
| **games.status** | `open` \| `full` \| `completed` \| `cancelled` for lifecycle and filtering |
| **games.updated_at** | Set when a game is completed (`complete_game`); added idempotently with gamification migration if missing |
| **game_participants.role** | `host` \| `player`; creator is inserted as host by `create_game()` |
| **game_participants.confirmed_result** | Whether this participant confirmed the game result |
| **user_stats** | One row per user: `games_played_total`, `games_played_by_sport`, `current_streak_days`, `longest_streak_days`, `xp`, `level`, `last_game_date` |
| **badges** | Definition table (slug, name, description, criteria); seeded with first_game, ten_games, streak_7, early_bird, rain_or_shine |
| **user_badges** | Which user has which badge (user_id, badge_id) |
| **notifications** | In-app toasts: user_id, type, payload, is_read |
| **game_results** | One row per completed game: game_id, winner_team_or_user, score, confirmed_by_host |

### Functions updated

- **get_profiles_nearby** – now returns `avatar_id` in the result set (for 3D avatar layer).
- **create_game** – sets `status = 'open'` and inserts the creator into `game_participants` with `role = 'host'`.
- **get_games_nearby** – now returns `status` so the app can filter or style by open/full/completed.

### RLS

- **user_stats**: select only for owner (stats updated by backend/Edge Function with service role).
- **badges**, **user_badges**: select for everyone.
- **notifications**: select and update only for owner.
- **game_results**: select for everyone.

### Next step (recommended)

Implement an **Edge Function** (or Postgres function called via service role) that runs when a game is marked completed:

1. Insert into **game_results**.
2. Update **games.status** to `completed`.
3. For each participant, update **user_stats** (games_played_total, streak, xp, level) and check **badges** criteria → insert into **user_badges** and **notifications**.

Then wire the frontend: call that function when the host confirms the result, and subscribe to **notifications** (Supabase Realtime) for toasts.

## 2025-03-21 – Per-game chat + roster counts

**File:** `migrations/20250321000000_game_chat_roster.sql`  
**Run after:** prior game migrations (needs `games.description` from `20250320000001_games_description.sql` if `get_games_nearby` selects it).

### What was added

| Change | Purpose |
|--------|--------|
| **game_messages** | Chat rows: `game_id`, `user_id`, `body`, `created_at`; RLS so only **game_participants** can read/insert |
| **supabase_realtime** publication | `game_messages` added for Postgres Changes (idempotent check) |
| **get_games_nearby** | Returns **participant_count** and **spots_remaining** (`spots_needed - count`, floored at 0) |
| **get_my_game_inbox()** | Joined games for `auth.uid()` with last message preview + roster fields |

### App behavior

- Map marker label uses **participant_count** / **spots_needed** from RPC.
- **Join** refetches nearby games so **spots left** updates.
- Messenger inbox calls **`get_my_game_inbox`**; thread uses **`game_messages`** + Realtime INSERT filter `game_id=eq.{id}`.
